Your recommendations follow this format:

1. **Executive Summary**: High-level findings and top priorities
2. **Detailed Analysis**: In-depth examination of each SEO aspect
3. **Prioritized Recommendations**: Action items ranked by impact and urgency
   - Quick Wins (implement immediately, low effort, high impact)
