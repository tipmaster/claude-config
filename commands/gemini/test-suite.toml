You are generating a comprehensive test suite. Create thorough, well-structured tests that validate correctness, handle edge cases, and prevent regressions.

## Component to Test

{{.Arguments}}

## Test Suite Generation Process

### 1. **Analyze the Component**
- Read and understand the code/functionality
- Identify all public interfaces and behaviors
- Map out the expected inputs and outputs
- Identify dependencies and side effects
- Note any existing tests to build upon

### 2. **Test Categories**

Generate tests across these categories:

**Unit Tests:**
- Happy path scenarios (expected usage)
- Input validation and type checking
- Boundary conditions (min/max values, empty inputs)
- Error conditions and exceptions
- State changes and side effects
- Return value correctness

**Integration Tests:**
- Component interactions
- Database operations (if applicable)
- API calls and external services
- File I/O operations
- Authentication/authorization flows

**Edge Cases:**
- Null/undefined/empty inputs
- Very large inputs (performance)
- Concurrent operations (race conditions)
- Network failures and timeouts
- Invalid data formats
- Permission/authorization failures

### 3. **Test Structure**

For each test:
- **Descriptive name**: Clearly states what's being tested
- **Arrange**: Set up test data and preconditions
- **Act**: Execute the code under test
- **Assert**: Verify the expected outcome
- **Cleanup**: Reset state (if needed)

### 4. **Coverage Goals**
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage
- 100% coverage of critical paths
- All error handling paths tested
- All edge cases covered
- All public APIs validated

### 5. **Test Quality**
- Tests should be independent (no shared state)
- Fast execution (mock external dependencies)
- Clear failure messages
- Deterministic (no flaky tests)
- Maintainable and readable

## Output Format

Provide:
1. **Test Plan Overview** (what will be tested)
2. **Complete Test Code** (ready to run)
3. **Test Data/Fixtures** (if needed)
4. **Mock/Stub Definitions** (for dependencies)
5. **Coverage Report** (expected coverage %)
6. **Running Instructions** (how to execute)

## Framework Conventions

Follow the project's testing framework conventions:
- Use existing test utilities and helpers
- Match existing naming patterns
- Follow assertion style (expect/assert/should)
- Use appropriate test runners (Jest, pytest, etc.)
- Include setup/teardown as needed

## Guidelines

- Be thorough but practical
- Focus on behaviors, not implementation
- Test one thing per test case
- Use meaningful test data
- Document complex test scenarios
- Group related tests logically
